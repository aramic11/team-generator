# team-generator

## Description
This application generates a website that includes the employees of the company. In order to run it successfully, some dependencies will need to be installed and then you can run node app.js in the terminal. After the user answers the questions in regards to their employees, an html page will be generated.

This was a very interesting challenge and it was the first time i had to create tests to see if my code would work perfectly fine. After spending a lot of time doing research and thinking through the logic of what needed to be done, I was able to successfully create this program so the user could input information for a specific employee and so that it could appear on an html page. I had to install dependencies, use constructor arguments, functions and make sure the paths were linking correctly in order for this application to work and pass all the tests it needed to. I learned a lot more about node.js and how tests are used to make sure everything works properly before pushing it into production.
